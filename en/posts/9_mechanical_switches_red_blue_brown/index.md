# 9 – Mechanical switches — Red, blue, brown. 

In this blog post, we are going back to basics. We take a closer look into the most important part of each mechanical keyboard. Mechanical switches. At the beginning, I need to point out that in this blog post I will focus only on tree basic ones. I will describe how they work, show some raw data and some characteristics and differences. Why only three of them? I think it’s enough at the beginning of the journey with mechanical keyboards. Obviously, there are plenty of mechanical switches, I do not know all of them for sure. Nevertheless, it’s diffs one from another with some minor details, which at the beginning will be impossible to notice.

## Red, Blue, Brown

**Red**, **Blue**, **Brown** that’s are colors of the basic switches which are made by a company called [Cherry](https://www.cherrymx.de/en "Cherry AG"). What’s this colors means and why? Usually, when we are describing keyboard we used to say company name, which produces this switches, in that case _Cherry_. The second thing is to name switches type, and that one we can distinguish by color. As switches case are typically black, the color of core which holds keycap is at the same time pointing type of switch. When you say **brown** switches, describes that kind of switch where the core is brown and the behavior of the switch is characteristic for it type.

I choose this particular three colors for purpose. Each of these is on a separate kind, which goes as fallow:
- Linear switches
	- Red switch
- Tactile switch
	- Brown switch
- Clicky switches
	- Blue switch

## Red switch: Linear
As first, we start with **linear** switches. The main feature of this switch is, as the name of it says, linearity. This mean that movement of switch is without any disturbance in comprehensive range. Below I posted an image presenting the work of **red** switch from inside.

As you can see on the picture, part witch touch metal activation element is flat. This allows for straight movement down, what’s more during pressing the switch you can’t fill any disturbances.

### Technical data of Red switch
- 45 cN operating force
- 2.0 mm activation point
- 4.0 mm total travel
- During activation: no click, no tactile feeling

## Brown switch: Tactile 
The **brown** switch belongs to the **tactile** group, as it was in the **red** one, naming comes from the characteristic of the switch itself during activation.
On the picture below, from inside, we can check how this switch works.

First difference in construction in comparison to **red** switch, apart from color of course, it’s how the core element is built. Especially small leg, which prevents activation. In case of a **red** switch, the surface of this element is flat. **Brown** one has small bulge, which is placed exactly on activation distance. This means that before activation under your finger, you should feel gentle tactile resistance of the key. You should be able to feel it with your touch, that’s the root cause of naming **brown** switch – tactile****. Furthermore, when contactor bumps on bulge during activation, you can hear a silent clicky sound.  

### Technical data of Brown switch
- 55 cN operating force
- 2.0 mm activation point
- 4.0 mm total travel
- During activation: silent click, tactile feeling

## Blue switch: Clicky
**Blue** switch. It’s nothing new when it came to naming, like it was with two previous cases. In this case, the name **clicky** comes from the characteristic sound during activation of the switch. **Blue** switch is loudest from all of the three, the exact point of activation can be known from the specific loud click. Let’s check how it is working. The chart below shows behavior of **blue** **clicky** switch:

In case of two mentioned switches, differences were small and depends entirely on contactor element. Construction of **blue** diffs much more. On the picture, you can see a white ring around the **blue** core of the switch. During activation this white ring fire down, during this rapid movement you can hear this clicky sound. 
### Technical data of Blue switch
- 60 cN operating force
- 2.2 mm activation point
- 4.0 mm total travel
- During activation: loud click


## Comparative analysis: which one form whom
It’s been said **red** switches are for _gamers_, **blue** for writers and **brown** for _undecided_ for two previous ones. This, in fact, is only partially true, you can't get this by word. Taking this sentence literally can lead to a situation when you will buy, or made, a keyboard with switches which you dislike the most. Let’s split the first sentence in this paragraph into parts and analyze it. 

### Red for gamers
From gamer perspective, you need _fast_ keyboard, so it should have the lowest latency possible to not slowing our reactions. **Red** switches have the lowest force, which is needed to press the switch, furthermore activation distance is _10%_ less than **blue** ones.  
Taking into consideration **brown** and **red** difference is less obvious, but on the other hand if we think a little we can see it. In case of **red** switch, the flat surface of connector arm allows for slightly faster move to start position because there is no disturbance during movement. Finally, **red** switches do not click. Do _gamers_ really require it? Usually professional _gamers_ are playing with headset, and they want to hear the game.
Sound of keyboard, it’s not relevant for them.

##  Blue for writers
Writing drastically differs from gaming. _Speed_ is not so critical anymore, feeling from writing becomes more important. **Blue** switches brings me memories of typing of _typewriters_, where on each keypress you need to put some force. Additionally, with each typed letter was accompanied by the sound of a hammer hitting a pice of paper. It’s being said, writing on **blue** switches is very satisfied and give that _feeling_ of typing.

### Brown for undecided 
It’s partially true, if you do not know which you should choose, pick **brown** ones and with highly probability, you will be satisfied. It’s the golden spot between gaming and writing. They need little more force with the same point of actuation like **red** switches. On the other hand, they give **tactile** feedback with salient click which is like **blue** ones. Versatility of **brown** switches became main strength, more about it in next chapter.


## My favorite – How about you?
Let’s start from the lowest place on the podium, where **red** switches are placed. I do not play games at all, so all benefits of gaming switches are in my case not benefits at all. I do not work with loud music and I really like sound of typing, what in case of **red** switches is not happening. 

The silver medal is going to **blue** switches. My work is directly connected to with typing and coding, what it’s still typing. As my first keyboard I choose **brown** switches, but as the saying goes _blue for writers_, I want to have **blue** switches. So, my first keyboard which I build contains, not, others but **blue** switches.  I’ve started to type and I need to admit, it’s very satisfied, furthermore it’s getting even better when you fall into rhythm – you can really feel the rate of typing which is divided by clicks.
It’s very pleased… But not after 8 or 10 hours… After longer period it starts to be more and more opposite of being advantage. Additionally, my kids screens from second room, “Dady, please shut it down!” :)

I still like this clicky keyboards and use them, but not as daily driver – for all day long. 


The winners are **brown** switches. Frankly, I am amazed that I liked most switches for *undecided*. In my opinion, each feature of **brown** switches is simply an advantage in my eyes. All new built by me keyboards are equipped with these switches. 

So, the question is why? In comparison, do **red** and **blue**, sound of **brown** is exactly on my level of acceptance. There are not too silent and on the other hand not tiring – after whole day sound of **brown** switches is still very nice and brings a lot of joy. The second big advantage is feeling during writing – you can feel the exact point of actuation. On **reeds**, you do not get it at all, with **blue** it’s more a matter of sound than feeling. The third strength is the sound of **brown** switches, which is _low_ like bass, not _high_ like **blue** switches. I am sure it is a matter of keyboard case, which acts like a sound box – it’s make sound of switch louder. If I could compare sound of key switches to some sound… I would say **brown** are like gun shots _low_, _empty_. **Blue** are like electrical shots.

I really liked sounds of gun shots…
